# School Scheduling Platform Testing Status

## Component Testing Results

We've created test scripts and infrastructure to validate the functionality of the major components:

### 1. Optimizer Service

- **Test Infrastructure**: Created a Docker-based test script that mounts test data and runs the optimizer
- **Test Files**: Provided test_with_data.py to validate the optimizer with actual input data
- **Coverage**: Tests the complete optimization pipeline including:
  - Data loading and validation
  - Domain model conversion
  - Greedy algorithm optimization
  - Results generation and output

### 2. Backend API

- **Test Infrastructure**: Created Jest-based tests for the backend API
- **Test Files**: Basic route existence tests in api.test.js
- **Coverage**: Validates the structure and organization of the API, but not full functionality yet

### 3. End-to-End Testing

- Created test_with_docker.sh script to run all component tests in Docker containers
- This ensures each component works in isolation

## Testing Results and Analysis

When running the tests in production, we would expect:

1. Optimizer tests confirm the scheduling algorithm works correctly with test data
2. Backend API tests confirm the server routes and controllers are properly set up
3. Docker-based tests confirm the containerized environment functions correctly

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing Improvements

1. **Optimizer Tests**:
   - Add more comprehensive test cases for different scheduling scenarios
   - Create validation tests to ensure constraints are respected
   - Add unit tests for specific algorithm components

2. **Backend Tests**:
   - Expand API tests to cover actual functionality, not just structure
   - Add integration tests for database operations
   - Add tests for authentication and authorization

3. **Frontend Tests** (once frontend is implemented):
   - Add unit tests for React components
   - Add integration tests for API interactions
   - Add end-to-end tests with Cypress or similar

### Development Next Steps

Based on our test infrastructure and CLAUDE.md notes, the next development steps should be:

1. **Frontend Development**: 
   - Implement React-based SPA with responsive design
   - Create component library with consistent styling
   - Set up state management using React Context or Redux

2. **Advanced Optimization**:
   - Implement MILP algorithm with Gurobi integration
   - Add performance optimizations for large datasets
   - Enhance constraint handling

3. **System Integration**:
   - Complete end-to-end testing of workflow
   - Implement AWS S3 integration
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
